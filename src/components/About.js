            <p>
                I am a blockchain developer with experience in smart contract development and
                decentralized applications (DApps). I have completed courses from DApp University,
                Moralis Academy, and freeCodeCamp. Proficient in JavaScript, React, and blockchain
                tools like Truffle, Hardhat, and Foundry, I’m passionate about leveraging decentralized
                technologies to build secure, innovative solutions. I look forward to contributing to
                impactful projects and collaborating with like-minded professionals.
