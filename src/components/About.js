            <p>
                Skilled blockchain developer. Done some free courses from youtube
                from channels like DApp Univeristy, Moralis Academy and freecodecamp.
                Previously I was doing Bs computer science. I have worked with C, C++, Java, 
                datastructures, Javascript and React. I am well versed in tools like
                truffle and hardhat. Proficient in using Chai, an expressive assertion
                library for JavaScript, to write clear and comprehensive test cases. 
                I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of decentralized technologies and 
                creating meaningful user experiences. I look forward to contributing my skills 
                to more innovative projects and collaborating with like-minded individuals and teams.
